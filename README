Examples of non-standard Commands:
On the Kodak unit, when you have five or less discs, command "I" for Input/Insert always returns E for failure (presumably to alert the kiosk operator that the device is running low) - you'll need to code around that if you want to be able to use the entire input capacity.

  F - Reset flags (aka set input bin #1 as the staring bin)
  P - Pick (before I/? in multiple drive bank systems)
